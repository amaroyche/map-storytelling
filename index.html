            <p>For decades, China has engaged in a systematic programme of repression in Xinjiang, focused on ethnic
              minority groups including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Uyghurs.</p>
            <p>Investigations and human rights groups have highlighted detention camps, forced labour and oppressive
              surveillance, all designed to force these majority Muslim people to ‘assimilate’ with mainstream Chinese
              culture.</p>

            <p>International responses to the human rights abuses have largely focused on goods produced in Xinjiang, in
              particular cotton.</p>

              <p>But more than cotton is shipped out of Xinjiang. Many Uyghurs, Kyrgyz and Kazakh people are coerced by local Chinese Communist Party officials into “labour transfer schemes”. Under this programme, the Chinese government moves thousands of ethnic minorities from Xinjiang to factories hundreds of miles away in the country’s biggest industrial zones.</p>
              <p>The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, working with Der Spiegel and the New York Times, has traced thousands of these transfers through videos uploaded by the workers themselves to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok.</p>

            <p>Party officials encourage transfer workers to contribute to the Chinese economy at departure ceremonies, adorning them with red rosettes and sashes. Sometimes they are moved under armed guard. This video shows a group of workers in Artush, in the far west of Xinjiang. They were transferred more than 2,000 miles east to Jiangsu to work at Elec & Eltek, a company that makes circuit boards for home appliance brands.</p>

            <p class="translation"><strong>Translation: </strong>Since last year, demonstration units such as Yangzhou Elec & Eltek Co., Ltd. and Wuxi Xinri Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd. have recruited more than 300 workers from Kezhou. Rusibai Abdureheman, who works at Wuxi Xinri Electric Vehicle Co., Ltd., has paid for Wuxi's local social insurance through the Jiangsu-Ke exchange and integration demonstration unit work mechanism. She said: "I can now enjoy the same treatment as Wuxi citizens, all thanks to Jiangsu's aid to Xinjiang!</p>

            <p>In a presentation posted to LinkedIn, Elec & Eltek identified some of the brands it claims to work with. TBIJ did not trace all of these relationships, but we were able to establish that Elec & Eltek circuit boards end up in the supply chain of LG. There’s no suggestion that the other companies in the slide deck benefited from forced labour.</p>
            <p>Elec & Eltek’s Yangzhou operation is one of 75 factories across China supplying more than 100 global brands identified by TBIJ as benefiting from forced labour from Xinjiang.</p>

            <p>The factory workers are paid. But the oppression in Xinjiang has led experts to label this transfer system state-sponsored forced labour.</p>
            <p>“When a government official knocks on the door of a Uyghur person and says they should take a job far from home, the person knows this is not merely a request,” said Laura Murphy, a former senior policy adviser to the Biden administration on Chinese forced labour. “They know there are directives that say refusal is punishable by detention. And they know how horrible detention is. Every Uyghur in Xinjiang has either been in detention themselves or has someone close to them who has been. This is not a choice. This is not consent.”</p>
            <p>Even after leaving Xinjiang, workers find themselves being closely monitored by ‘minders’. When more than 30 people are moved at once, they’re accompanied by security guards.</p>

            <p>In some factories, workers make products that are sold directly to Chinese customers. In others, they make parts for global supply chains that loop around the globe. Whole industries, especially cars and home appliances, are implicated.</p>
            <p>The cars, shoes, tech and appliances made with this forced labour end up being sold both in China and around the world. TBIJ tracked products to 86 different countries, including the UK. Forced Xinjiang labour has become almost inescapable in Chinese exports.</p>

            <p>A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the US said “allegations of ‘forced labour’ in Xinjiang are nothing but vicious lies concocted by anti-China forces”. They said members of all ethnic groups there “enjoy happy and fulfilled lives”. They added: “Xinjiang-related issues are not human rights issues at al, but in essence about countering violent terrorism and separatism.”</p>
