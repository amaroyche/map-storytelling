            <p>For decades, China has engaged in a systematic programme of repression in Xinjiang, focused on ethnic
              minority groups including Kazakhs, Kyrgyz and Uyghurs.</p>
            <p>Investigations and human rights groups have highlighted detention camps, forced labour and oppressive
              surveillance, all designed to force these majority Muslim people to ‘assimilate’ with mainstream Chinese
              culture.</p>

            <p>International responses to the human rights abuses have largely focused on goods produced in Xinjiang, in

            <p>But more than cotton is shipped out of Xinjiang. Many Uyghurs, Kyrgyz and Kazakh people are coerced by
              local Chinese Communist Party officials into “labour transfer schemes”. The Bureau of Investigative
              Journalism, working with Der Spiegel and the New York Times, has traced thousands of these transfers
              through videos uploaded by the workers themselves to Douyin, China’s version of TikTok.</p>

            <p>Party officials encourage transfer workers to contribute to the Chinese economy at departure ceremonies,
              adorning them with red rosettes and sashes. Sometimes they are moved under armed guard. This video shows a
              group of workers in Artush, in the far west of Xinjiang. They were transferred more than 2,000 miles east
              to Jiangsu to work at Elec & Eltek.</p>

              It’s one of 75 factories across China supplying more than 100 global brands identified by TBIJ as
              benefiting
              from forced labour from Xinjiang. We looked at tens of thousands of videos to find workers who’d been
              moved
              under the scheme and work out where they’d been sent.

            <p>“The factory workers are paid. But the atmosphere of oppression in Xinjiang has led experts to label this
              transfer system state-sponsored forced labour.”</p>
            <p>“When a government official knocks on the door of a Uyghur person and says they should take a job far from
              home, the person knows this is not merely a request,” said Laura Murphy, a former senior policy adviser to
              the Biden administration on Chinese forced labour. “They know there are directives that say refusal is
              punishable by detention. And they know how horrible detention is. Every Uyghur in Xinjiang has either been
              in detention themselves or has someone close to them who has been. This is not a choice. This is not
              consent.”</p>
            <p>“Even after leaving Xinjiang, workers find themselves being closely monitored by ‘minders’. When more than
              30 people are moved at once, they’re accompanied by security guards.</p>
